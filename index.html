             <h2>THE CRAFT</h2>
             <p>PATTA, or patta chitra, is one of the typical regional arts of the coastal state of Orissa in eastern India. Like any other type of painting, regardless of time and space, it has its own meaning and purpose. In particular, he shows some of the religious and mythological aspects of Oriya culture, focusing on the Hindu epics in general, the Mahabharata and Ramayana and the Jagannath sect in particular. Patta paint has a linear design, plant pigments are applied with a brush to a specially prepared canvas. While clearly religious, it is more than just an expression of a set of religious ideas or values, and it is more than just visual art to be viewed and observed. highly regarded: it embodies the full spectrum of beliefs and practices concerning life and death that were among the artisans themselves, traditionally practiced only by the Chitrakara caste as their profession, however, although it retained its basic characteristics, it was influenced by the advent of science and techniques, as well as other aspects of the modernization process in the 20th century, influenced the technology, the materials used, the commercialization and the use of crafts. Thus, to some extent, patta painting stands at the crossroads of tradition and modernity, which heralds an uncertain future for the craft.

                Patta painting is performed on a sheet of paper or canvas with a primer called patta. it has other meanings. According to the artists themselves, the painting was previously done using a local hemp brush called patta. Others say that the traditional style of painting is done on a piece of wood called a patta. , the first explanation seems to be more reliable and is widely accepted by artists and commentators. The use of canvas as a background for paintings according to myths goes back to the days of Dvapara, when Radha painted a picture in her letter to Krishna. As old as the appearance of paper in the world. From this point of view, in the distant past, walls were the only medium of painting depicting various Hindu or tribal gods and goddesses. They were written into it, which the artists carried from place to place. These paintings are called patta chitras, and groups who use this form of painting as a caste practice are known as chitrakaras.</p>

            <h2>THE ORIGIN</h2>
            <p>Originated and based in the eastern Indian states of Odisha, and West Bengal, Pattachitra is a scroll painting done on cloth. The name has been derived from a Sanskrit word which when broken into two parts, <em>'Patta'</em>  means cloth and  <em>'Chitra'</em> means picture. Pattachitra depicts ancient frescoes in Odisha dating from the 5th century BC, especially in the religious centers of Puri, Konark and the Bhubaneswar region. Raghurajpur, a village in Odisha state, 10 km from Puri and 55 km from the state capital, Bhubaneswar, is home to Pattachitra's finest works. Pattachitra form of art is closely related to the cult of Lord Jagganath and the temple traditions in Puri. The art form is considered to as one of the most living art forms of Odisha and has been in practice even now. The Pattachitra artform narrates mythology and folktales through their designs. The art form has been practiced by the Chitrakar Community of Raghurajpur. The traditions of Pattachitra paintings are more than 1000 years old</p>
